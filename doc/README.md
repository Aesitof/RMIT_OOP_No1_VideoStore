## `Project Descriptions`
- _This is a group project from course INTE2512 Object-Oriented Programming of RMIT University Vietnam - Semester A 2023._
- _The project application will handle some crucial paper-work of a **normal Rental Store** and make it more convenient by changing into computer-based tasks._
- _To advance our skills learning, we have covered all the [project requirements](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/118552/files/30583200?wrap=1) and mostly used techniques delivered from the course._
